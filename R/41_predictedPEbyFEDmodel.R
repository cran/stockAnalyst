#'Calculates predicted value of Price to Earning Multiple based on yields on bonds.
#'@description
#'The US FED model based on a paper written by three analysts, Lander, Orphanides, and Douvogiannis in 1997, at the US Federal Reserve, predicts the return on the S&P 500 on the basis of the relationship between forecasted earnings yields and yields on bonds (as cited in Jerald E. Pinto, 2020).
