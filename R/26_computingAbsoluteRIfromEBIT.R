#'Calculates Residual Income using given values of Earnings Per Share (EPS) and beginning Book Values Per Share(bgnBVPS) for a specified number of years.
#'@details
#' Residual Income is computed in three steps. Here, Step 1 is to compute \code{preTaxIncome} as (EBIT minus \code{rd} multiplied with debt). Step 2 is to get \code{netIncome} as (\code{preTaxIncome} minus (\code{t} multiplied with \code{preTaxIncome}) ), and finally step 3 is to obtain the Residual Income (RI) as \code{netIncome} minus (\code{r} times \code{equity}).
#'According to information provided by Jerald E. Pinto (2020), the method \code{computingAbsoluteRI} is developed to compute absolute value of Residual Income. Here, \code{EBIT} is a number vector that hold values of EBIT in millions of dollars, \code{debt} is a number vector that has dollar value of debt (expressed in millions of dollars), \code{equity} is a number vector that holds dollar value of equity (expressed in millions of dollars), \code{r} required rate of return on equity (expressed in decimal terms), \code{rd} is cost of debt (expressed in decimal terms), and \code{t} is rate of taxes. Output gives dollar value of Residual Income (expressed in millions of dollars).
