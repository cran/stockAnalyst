\title{Calculates value of share using two stage H-Model that considers half of the length of the super-normal growth period.}
\usage{
shareValUsingTwoStageHmodel(divNot, r, n, H, gS, gL)
}
\arguments{
\item{divNot}{A number.}

\item{r}{A number.}

\item{n}{A number.}

\item{H}{A number.}

\item{gS}{A number.}

\item{gL}{A number.}
}
\value{
Input values to six arguments  \code{divNot}  , \code{r}, \code{n}, \code{H}, \code{gS} and \code{gL}.
}
\description{
The basic two-stage model assumes a constant, extraordinary rate for the super-normal growth period that is followed by a constant, normal growth rate thereafter. The difference in growth rates may be substantial. For instance, the growth rate for the company Carl Zeiss Meditec was 9 percent annually for 10 years, followed by a drop to 5 percent growth in Year 11 and thereafter. In some cases, a smoother transition to the mature phase growth rate would be more realistic (Jerald E. Pinto, 2020).

\details{
According to information provided by Jerald E. Pinto (2020), the method \code{shareValUsingTwoStageHmodel} is developed to compute value of share using two stage H-Model for the values passed to its six arguments. Here, \code{divNot} is dollar value of the current dividend, \code{r} is required rate of return on equity, \code{n} is number of years of super-normal growth period, \code{H} is which is one-half of n (that is half of the length of the super-normal growth period), \code{gS} is initial short-term dividend growth rate, and \code{gL} is normal long-term dividend growth rate after Year 2H (that is n).
