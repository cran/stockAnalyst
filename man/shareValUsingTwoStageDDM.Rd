\description{
Two-stage DDM provides for a high growth rate for the initial period, followed by a sustainable and usually lower growth rate thereafter. The two-stage DDM is based on the multiple-period model. The two-stage model assumes that the first n dividends grow at an extraordinary short-term rate(gS) and after time n, the annual dividend growth rate changes to a normal long-term rate (gL). The two-stage DDM is useful because many scenarios exist in which a company can achieve a super-normal growth rate for a few years, after which time the growth rate falls to a more sustainable level. For example, a company may achieve super-normal growth through possession of a patent, first-mover advantage, or another factor that provides a temporary lead in a specific marketplace. Subsequently, earnings will most likely descend to a level that is more consistent with competition and growth in the overall economy. Accordingly, that is why in the two-stage model, extraordinary growth is often forecast for a few years and normal growth is forecast thereafter. A possible limitation of the two-stage model is that the transition between the initial abnormal growth period and the final steady-state growth period is abrupt (Jerald E. Pinto, 2020).

\details{
According to information provided by Jerald E. Pinto (2020), the method \code{shareValUsingtwoStageHmodel} is developed to compute value of share using two stage H-Model for the values passed to its five arguments. Here, \code{divNot} is dollar value of the current dividend, \code{r} is required rate of return on equity, \code{n} is number of years of super-normal growth period, \code{gS} is initial short-term dividend growth rate, and \code{gL} is normal long-term dividend growth rate.
